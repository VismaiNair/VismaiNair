# Hi, I'm Vismai (/'vÉªs.mÉ‘Éª/)ðŸ‘‹

I'm a middle-school student based in the western part of the US. I occassionally gather up my strength and make a feeble attempt to code, but I have never succeeded.

## Open-Source Contribution
Here's some things I contribute to:
* Anything that I can contribute to that is made by Google
* Projects with lots of CSS
  * Take a look at my minified CSS normalizer or my pre-made stylesheets!
* UX/UI-related projects

## Programming Languages, Markup Languages, and JS-related stuff
* Programming & Markup I use reglarly:
  * HTML & XML
  * SCSS & CSS
  * JavaScript (Frontend JS, Node.JS, and TypeScript)
* JavaScript Frameworks:
  * Svelte
* I'm Learning:
  * PostgreSQL
  * Dart

```
