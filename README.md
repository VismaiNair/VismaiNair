# Hi, I'm Vismai (/'vɪs.mɑɪ/)👋

I'm a middle-school student based in the western part of the US. I occassionally gather up my strength and make a feeble attempt to code, but I have never succeeded.

## Programming Languages
[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=VismaiNair)](https://github.com/VismaiNair/VismaiNair)

I'm also working on a package to convert from vanity phone numbers to numeric and vice versa! [phonewords](https://pub.dev/packages/phonewords) [gophonewords](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vismainair/gophonewords)

Also see [wasmate](github.com/vismainair/wasmate) for a Go WASM workflow tool - hot reload, initialization, wasm_exec.js copying, build wrapper etc.
