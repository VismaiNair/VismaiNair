# Hi, I'm Vismai (/'vÉªs.mÉ‘Éª/)ðŸ‘‹

I'm a middle-school student based in the western part of the US. I occassionally gather up my strength and make a feeble attempt to code, but I have never succeeded.

## Open-Source Contribution
Here's some things I contribute to:
* Anything that I can contribute to that is made by Google
* Projects with lots of CSS
  * Take a look at my minified CSS normalizer or my pre-made stylesheets!
* UX/UI-related projects

I'm also working on a pub package to convert from vanity phone numbers to numeric and vice versa!
